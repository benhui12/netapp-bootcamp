# Upgrading with the Trident Operator

**Objective:**  
Trident 20.04 introduced a new way to manage its lifecycle: Operators. For Trident 20.04 this installation method is only intended for greenfield environments. With the release of Trident 20.07 the installation method is now also available for brownfield environments.  

This task provides an easy upgrade path for users that seek to use the operator and greatly simplify Tridentâ€™s operation. Trident will upgraded to the latest release, from the previous release (n-1) that got installed in [Trident installation with an Operator](../trident_install)  

For the official documentation describing all pre-requisites on upgrading with the Trident Operator, please see:  
<https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kubernetes/upgrades/operator-upgrade.html>

**Note:** All below commands are to be run against the dev cluster. Unless specified differently, please connect using PuTTY to the dev k8s cluster's master node (rhel5) to proceed with the task.  

### Optional tasks to demonstrate behaviour during upgrade

If you wish to see how applications behave during a Trident upgrade and also how applications can still be deployed during the upgrade, below are some optional tasks that you can carry out via Putty on the **`rhel5`** host as you move from Trident 20.04 to 20.07:

So that you can deploy a basic file-based application you will need to skip ahead and define a set of backends and storageclasses ([file](../config_file/).  Once done, you will then be able to deploy (to the dev cluster) the [file application using the guide from the production tasks](../file_app/).  You can then use this application to see how it behaves during the upgrade.  You can deploy a second instance of the file app in a separate namespace mid-upgrade to show how new applications can still be deployed during this process.

## A. Remove existing Trident Operator Deployment

Connect using PuTTY to the dev k8s cluster's master node, **rhel5**, and remove any existing Trident Operator deployments.  

```bash
[root@rhel5 ~]# cd ~/trident-installer
[root@rhel5 trident-installer]# kubectl delete -f deploy/bundle.yaml
serviceaccount "trident-operator" deleted
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "trident-operator" deleted
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io "trident-operator" deleted
deployment.apps "trident-operator" deleted
podsecuritypolicy.policy "tridentoperatorpods" deleted
```

Now that the Trident Operator has been removed, if you are also doing the optional application deployments during this task, go ahead and deploy the second instance of the file application to the dev cluster using [the guide from the production tasks](../file_app/).

You will see that applications can still be deployed while Trident is being upgraded and your original file application is also still running.

## B. Download & setup the latest Trident Operator release

Following this, you can now install the latest release of the operator by fetching the latest installer bundle and then re-installing the operator.

**Note:** We have only deleted the Trident Operator but the Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) are still present as is the trident namespace and all of the Trident Provisioner (CSI) components. The downloaded Trident Installer contains manifests for re-creating the resources with the desired version (latest).  

```bash
[root@rhel5 ~]# cd
[root@rhel5 ~]# mv trident-installer/ trident-installer_20.04
[root@rhel5 ~]# wget https://github.com/NetApp/trident/releases/download/v20.07.0/trident-installer-20.07.0.tar.gz
[root@rhel5 ~]# tar -xf trident-installer-20.07.0.tar.gz
[root@rhel5 ~]# cd trident-installer
[root@rhel5 trident-installer]# kubectl create -f deploy/bundle.yaml
serviceaccount/trident-operator created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/trident-operator created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/trident-operator created
deployment.apps/trident-operator created
podsecuritypolicy.policy/tridentoperatorpods created
```

If we are quick enough to view all of the objects in the trident namespace we can notice that the trident-operator has already a running status and that the old csi pods are being terminated and new pods are in the process of being created.

You can use tridentctl or kubectl to verify the new version of Trident.

```bash
[root@rhel5 trident-installer]# ./tridentctl -n trident version

## C. What's next

Now that Trident is installed, you can proceed to:  

- Next task: [Installing Prometheus & incorporate Trident's metrics](../config_prometheus)

or jump ahead to...  

- [Configure your first NAS backends & storage classes](../config_file)
